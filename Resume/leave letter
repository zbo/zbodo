Hi All:
	As some of you already knows, I will leave dnvs quite soon.
	8-31 will be my last day here.
	
	By spending almost 3 years here, with the feeling I would spend life long time
	here at the begining, it was quite sad decison for me to choose leave, anyway;
	life is full of changes, which is hard to pridict, At this moment I feel it's 
	better to figure out the future myself. 

	Dnv software is the first company I served, and those experience here will always
	put in my resume in future. the company give me chance to practice and grow up,
   	from a naive young boy to a sophisticated engineer. and here will always be
	treated as concrete base of my career life, I will miss time I spend here, spend 
	with you guys. playing basket ball or playing volleyball as football with you 
	will kept in my mind as best memory. I guess I can never find another company 
	have basketball yard at front of the door, so decide to spend the rest of my 
	life missing it.

	DNVS paied me 3 years salary, at the point of leaving, I really want to show
	some achievement or contribution here, sadly can not find anything worth to mension.
	By making as many bugs as features into our system, I fullfill our tester's time sheet, 
	that may be can list as one:)

	To Developers and Testers:
		always believe you are heros!
		you make the most exciting part of software world.
		you are the hope and future of dnv software.
		working as a hero, make the magic happen!

That's all would like to say before I leave.
